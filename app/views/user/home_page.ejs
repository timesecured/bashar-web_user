     												<p>For a number of reasons people may not want to share some sensitive information with their loved ones while they are alive, but they want to make sure they have this information once they pass.</p>

     												<p>A passing vault is the main reason for the app.  It allows you to share the vault and its contents in a way that makes sure your beneficiary or beneficiaries can get the files in the vault you created, even after you pass away.</p>

     												<p>If you pass away, the chosen beneficiary can request access to the information through a link in the email they receive; which will be sent to them after you add them to the vault.</p>

     												<p>When the request is made, the user who created the vault will get an alert; and will have either 3 days or one week to reject access if they are still alive or don’t want to share the documents just yet.  This time period is chosen when the vault is created by the user.</p> 

     												<p>If there is no rejection, the beneficiary will be sent all the files in the vault through the selected beneficiary email.</p>

     												<p>The trigger vault is an added feature to the Time Secured app.  It allows the user to create a vault and set a date and time to share the vault with the selected beneficiary..</p>

     												<p>There is no email request required, when the time for the vault arrives, the documents will be automatically shared with the beneficiary by email.</p>

     												<p>It is a great way to share information if you know the exact time you want to do so. Once you set the time trigger, just forget about it and Time Secured will make sure the documents are sent on time to the chosen beneficiaries.</p> 

     												<p>This can be useful if you want to share documents to children once they reach a certain age or after a certain event.  It can also be useful for sharing signed documents and agreements at a specific time for example</p>
